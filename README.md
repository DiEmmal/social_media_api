1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiEmmal/social_media_api.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables, get the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`, then fill in the values

```bash
PORT=3000                               # Port to run the application on
NODE_ENV=development                    # Application environment (development | production)
PUBLIC_PATH=public                      # Public path for static files and root endpoint
MONGO_URL=mongodb://...                 # MongoDB connection string
MONGO_USER=root                         # MongoDB username for docker-compose.yml
MONGO_PASS=secret                       # MongoDB password for docker-compose.yml
MONGO_DB_NAME=mydatabase                # MongoDB database name
MAILER_SERVICE=gmail                    # Mail service (e.g., gmail)
MAILER_EMAIL=example@gmail.com          # Email address used for sending emails
MAILER_SECRET_KEY=xxxx                  # App password (requires 2-step verification)
WEBSERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3000    # Application root URL
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret              # Secret key for signing JWT tokens
```

4. Configure the database with docker-compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. Run the application
   For development, use:

```bash
